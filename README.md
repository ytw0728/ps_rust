# PS with Rust

This repository was created to make an environment providing a boilerplate to do boj.kr or leetcode, via VSC and its `Task` feature.

After cloning this, I recommend installing entire VSC extensions in `.vscode/extensions.json` to get an easier way to execute each task.

Now, I would like to provide other new features including basic data structures, simplified io macro, one-click submission, etc.  
Please feel free to suggest any other things for it!
